# Computer Vision & Image Processing

## Overview
This repository documents my progress through the **Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing** course by IBM. The course covers fundamental concepts of computer vision, image processing techniques, and their applications in various industries. It also includes hands-on labs with Python, Pillow, and OpenCV for image processing, image classification, and object detection.

## Content
- **Introduction to Computer Vision**
- **Basic Image Processing Techniques** (Using Python, Pillow, and OpenCV)
- **Image Classification & Object Detection**
- **Using Jupyter Notebooks and CV Studio**
- **Building and Deploying a Computer Vision Web App**

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pillow**
- **OpenCV**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CV Studio**
- **Cloud Deployment**
